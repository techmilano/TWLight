"""
This file holds user profile information. (The base User model is part of
Django; profiles extend that with locally useful information.)

TWLight has three user types:
* editors
* coordinators
* site administrators.

_Editors_ are Wikipedia editors who are applying for TWL resource access
grants. We track some of their data here to facilitate access grant
decisions.

_Coordinators_ are the Wikipedians who have responsibility for evaluating
and deciding on access grants. Site administrators should add editors to the
Coordinators group through the Django admin site.

_Site administrators_ have admin privileges for this site. They have no special
handling in this file; they are handled through the native Django is_admin
flag, and site administrators have responsibility for designating who has that
flag through the admin site.

New users who sign up via oauth will be created as editors. Site administrators
may promote them to coordinators manually in the Django admin site, by adding
them to the coordinators group. They can also directly create Django user
accounts without attached Editors in the admin site, but this has no current
use case.
